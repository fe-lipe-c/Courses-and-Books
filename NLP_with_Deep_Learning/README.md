# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

This is a repo for the Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course, offered by Stanford  in 2022, available [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), with [Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ) from 2021.

### Description

Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, politics, etc. In the last decade, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models, using the Pytorch framework. 


### Material

The material consists of several lecture notes.

- [ ] Lecture 1: Word Vectors I: Introduction, SVD and Word2Vec.
- [ ] Lecture 2: Word Vectors II: GloVe, Evaluation and Training.
