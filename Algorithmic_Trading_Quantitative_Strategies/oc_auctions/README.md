# Open and Close Auctions

Usually, exchanges have opening and closing auctions for all assets that are traded. At the beginning and ending of every trading day, an auction is conducted where any market player can place a bid or an ask, specifying the quantity and price, and a matching mechanism clears the orders, maximizing the volume traded.
