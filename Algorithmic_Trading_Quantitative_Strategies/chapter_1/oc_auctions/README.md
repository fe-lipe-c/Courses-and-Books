# Opening and Closing Auctions

Usually, exchanges have opening and closing auctions for all assets that are traded. At the beginning and ending of every trading day, an auction is conducted where any market player can place a bid or an ask, specifying the quantity and price, and a matching mechanism clears the orders, maximizing the volume traded. The main objectives of these auctions are to reveal the price after several hours in which the market was closed, in the case of the opening auction, and to set a price that occurs through high liquidity. This last point is very important, since the opening and closing prices are used widely throughout the industry for analysis and decision making.

In the Brazilian market, B3 has well defined [rules](https://www.b3.com.br/pt_br/produtos-e-servicos/negociacao/renda-variavel/mercado-de-acoes/caracteristicas-e-regras.htm) on how the auction will be held. The opening auction lasts 15 minutes, while the closing auction lasts 5 minutes.

#### To Do

- [X] Prices path after opening auction
- [ ] Bid and ask through auction
- [X] For each negative or positive change between auctions, make a scatter plot of var_vol and var_price (first hour of the day)
