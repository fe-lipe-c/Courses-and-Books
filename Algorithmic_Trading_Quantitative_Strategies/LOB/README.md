# Limit Order Book

A limit order book (LOB) is a mechanism that organizes buy and sell orders, sent to a exchange, by agents.
The Limit Order Book (LOB) supports three basic instructions: insert, cancel and amend. Insert initiate a new order, that must specify an "order type" and associated parameters. Cancel remove an existing order and amend modify some of the parameters of the existing order.
